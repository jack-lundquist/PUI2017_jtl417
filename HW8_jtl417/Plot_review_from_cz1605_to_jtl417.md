This plot is showing the relationship between the assessed value of property in a community district and the square footage of various kinds of property in that district. The Y and X axes are the same across plots to allow for an intuitive comparison. Shown in black is the regression line generated from the points seen in grey - each point corresponds to a certain community district. The range of the y axes are $0 - $4,000,000, and the range of the x axes are 0 - 4e8 square feet. The trend lines show the positive relationship between square footage and value, which is meant to communicate that areas that are more built up are by and large more valuable.

#### CLARITY: 
* It is great that the caption part provides detail description of the figure.
* There are 5 subplots with an overall y axis label, 5 different x axis labels, and 5 linear regression results of the correlation between assessed value of property and square footage of various kinds of property in a community district. Your idea of making Y and X axes the same across plots to allow for an intuitive comparison is great but I think this way of visulization brings the following negative effects.
* The Y axis of each subplot is so short that lots of scatters can not be seen clearly
* The X axes are the same, only showing and comparing different ranges of the square footage of various kinds of property in all districts which is not a very useful information.
* The bottom suplot is too small with scatters and fit line only located on the left corner.
* There should a title briefly introduing the content of this plot.
* I think it is better to make 5 individual plots to show the linear regression results.

#### AETHETIC: 
* The whole plot only has two colors, including black and gray. I think using more colorful colors will attract readers more since there are 5 subplots.


#### HONESTY: 
* The plot shows 5 simple linear regression results and honestly reproduces the data.
